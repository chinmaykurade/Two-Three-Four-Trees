# Two-Three-Four-Trees

Two-three-four trees (also known as Two-four trees and hereby referenced as 2-3-4 trees) is a self balancing data structure. It can be considered as a generalisation of the AVL tree.

## General Rules for implementing a 2-3-4 tree

### 1. Each internal node must have atleast 1 and atmost 3 data elements

### 2. Each data element has a left child and a right child. Hence, each internal node must have minimum 2 and maximum 4 children, hence the name 2-3-4 trees

### 3. Any sub-trees of a particular node must have same depth(or height)
